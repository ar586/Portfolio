# My Journey

## Early Life & Schooling
Growing up in a paramilitary family, I had the unique opportunity to travel across India, living in diverse places such as Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad, Talcher, Patratu, Phusro, and currently Delhi. This lifestyle meant constant change—I attended 8 different schools during my primary and secondary education.

I completed my 10th grade at O.P. Jindal School, Patratu. Although I was a good student, the cancellation of board exams resulted in a score of 84%, which was a pivotal moment for me.

## JEE Preparation & High School
Moving to Delhi marked the beginning of my serious academic pursuit. I joined a local coaching institute for JEE preparation. The first two years were a struggle as I adapted to the rigorous environment. Despite the challenges, I secured a **97.2 percentile** in JEE Mains during my 12th grade attempt and achieved **88%** in my Class 12th Board exams.

## The Drop Year
Determined to improve, I took a drop year and enrolled in Mohit Tyagi sir's **Compitishun** coaching. The dedication paid off:
*   **JEE Mains:** 99.4 percentile
*   **JEE Advanced:** Rank 11,000

## College Life at NSUT
I joined **Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT)** to pursue **Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence (CSAI)**.

College became a time for holistic growth. I shifted my focus slightly from pure academics to personal skills, picking up **cooking**, **reading**, and **playing the guitar**.

### Academic Performance
Initially, this shift impacted my grades, but I bounced back strongly:
*   **1st Semester:** 7.4 SGPA
*   **2nd Semester:** 7.33 SGPA
*   **3rd Semester:** 8.18 SGPA
*   **Current Overall CGPA:** 7.63
