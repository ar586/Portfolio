# Personal Life & Interests

## Hobbies

### Reading
Reading is my oldest and dearest hobby. My early memories involve begging my mother for the latest issues of *Champak* and *Magic Pot*. I have read over **100 novels** in my life.

*   **Favorite Books:** *A Thousand Splendid Suns*, *Pet Sematary*, *1984*, *The Kite Runner*, *Dark Matter*, *Project Hail Mary*, *The Book Thief*.
*   **Favorite Authors:** Khaled Hosseini, Stephen King.

### Cooking
I developed a love for cooking while being cut off from the world during the COVID-19 pandemic. Learning from my mother and YouTube, I have become very skilled at it.

### Music & Guitar
Playing the guitar is my newest interest. I am decent at it, though not an expert.
*   **Favorite Singers:** Mohit Chauhan, KK, Amit Trivedi, Atif Aslam.

## Personality & Beliefs
*   **Social Interaction:** I am terrible at initiating conversations with strangers and often go to great lengths to avoid it. However, once I am comfortable, I am a good entertainer.
*   **Philosophy:** "We sweat a lot of time imagining the future which isn't worth it because the greatest scriptwriter has already written our role. Instead of worrying about writing it, we should focus on acting the role out the best."
